Journey is a learning game I made for one of my courses during the pandemic. The students seemed a bit depressed with the lack of social interaction and the high volume of content they have to learn on their own, so I wanted to create something cute and lighthearted to motivate them.

The game allows the students to learn in a **non-linear** fashion—after the first steps they can follow wherever their passions lead them. (There are of course pointers in place so that they know which lessons are recommended to ace the final assignment.)

I sadly lost the blog post with the behind the scenes, but I still have some screenshots:
